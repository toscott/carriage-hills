                Annual Dues Notice
            </h2>
            <p>
                The 2023 annual assessments were due on 03/01/2023. Homeowners will need to reach out to the Carriage
                Hills Board for balance due on delinquent accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make your check to:<br>
                Carriage Hills Community Association
            </p>

                Delinquent dues accrue interest and fees are added if it is necessary to pursue
                collection and for a lien to be recorded. Your balance can escalate quickly if left
                unpaid. Please keep costs down by paying your dues promptly!
            </p>
            <p>
                We appreciate the majority of homeowners pay their dues on time!

                    Online payments have been disabled for the 2023 assessments. They will be reactivated next February for the 2024 assessments.

                       If you already pay your other bills (such as utilities) through your bank online, you can use this same system to pay your annual dues.
                        In this instance, your bank would cut a check and mail the payment on your behalf. No stamp or check is needed on your end. Homeowners should make Carriage Hills Community Association
                        a company payee and use their property address as their account number. List the mailing address as the Hwy K location listed above and on your fee letter.
                        Homeowners are responsible for investigating this option <a target="_blank" href="https://carriage-hills-subdivision.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documents/example-account-setup.png" class="light-link">with their bank</a>,
                        and should ensure their property address is noted on the payment.
