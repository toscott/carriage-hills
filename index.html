                Delinquent dues accrue interest and fees are added if it is necessary to pursue collection and for a
                lien to be recorded. Please keep costs down by paying your dues promptly!
            </p>
            <p>
                We appreciate the majority of homeowners pay their dues on time!

                    Other Ways to Pay
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to mailing your check to the above address, you also have these options to submit payment:
                <p>
                <ul>
                <li> Attend the annual homeowners meeting and hand your payment in-person to the treasurer. No stamp necessary. Card payments via Square will also be accepted.</li>
                <p></p>
                <li> Use your bank's online bill pay system: If you already pay your other bills (such as utilities) through your bank online, you can use this same system to pay your annual dues.
                     In this instance, your bank would cut a check and mail the payment on your behalf. No stamp or check is needed on your end. Homeowners should make Carriage Hills Community Association
                     a company payee and use their property address as their account number. List the mailing address as the Hwy K location listed above and on your fee letter.
                     Homeowners are responsible for investigating this option <a target="_blank" href="https://carriage-hills-subdivision.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documents/example-account-setup.png" class="light-link">with their bank</a>,
                    and should ensure their property address is noted on the payment. </li>
                </p></p>
                <li> New this year: Pay online via Square. Additional fees apply. Click

                    to pay.

                The bylaws do not allow for boats, campers, trailers, or other recreational vehicles to be kept or
                stored on the lot (unless stored in an enclosed garage). If you are doing temporary maintenance, approved construction, or
                packing/unpacking from a trip, please proactively email the
                <a href="mailto:carriagehillsacc@gmail.com">ACC</a> with your plans and date of completion. This prevents a homeowner from unexpectedly receiving a violation letter in the mail. Thank you!
